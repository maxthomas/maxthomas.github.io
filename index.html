      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p itemprop="description">
        I'm a software consultant focusing on software architecture
        and scalable software engineering. Much of my work has been in
        the realm of natural language processing and large-scale data
        sets. I prefer working in functional programming languages,
        such as Clojure and Haskell; I also am proficient in Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects I've worked on generally have two main aspects:
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I've worked on software to infer meaning from language
        (e.g., extraction and inference of knowledge); this allows
        organizations to more easily understand language data,
        especially with large data sets. For example, given a number
        of Tweets, how many mentions of CompanyX are there?
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, I also support researchers and other software
        developers by developing data schemas and technology for the
        representation and retrieval of natural language data. This
        facilitates collaboration and development of more flexible
        natural language processing software. Many organizations
        struggle with disparate representations of data: having a
        unified schema allows progress on the organization's mission
        instead of engineering intra-company solutions to manage data.
      </p>
      <p>
        I encourage you to view my work on Github or contact me with
        any questions you may have about my work or availability.
