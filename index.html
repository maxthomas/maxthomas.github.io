      <p itemprop="description">
        Greetings! I'm a technology consultant focusing on software
        architecture and scalable software engineering based in
        Florida. Projects I've worked on include two main thrusts:
        first, I've designed and developed software to infer meaning
        from language (e.g., extraction of named entities or
        knowledge); this allows humans to more easily infer meaning
        from language data, especially with large data sets. Second, I
        also support researchers and other software developers by
        developing data schemas for the representation of
        language. This facilitates collaboration and development of
        more advanced natural language processing toolkits.  I prefer
        working in functional programming languages, such as Clojure
        and Haskell; I also am proficient in Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        I encourage you to view my work on Github or contact me with
        any questions you may have.
