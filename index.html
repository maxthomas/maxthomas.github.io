      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p itemprop="description">
        Greetings! I'm a technology consultant focusing on software
        architecture and scalable software engineering based out of
        Florida. Much of my work has been related, in some way, to
        natural language processing and large-scale data sets. I
        prefer working in functional programming languages, such as
        Clojure and Haskell; I also am proficient in Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects I've worked on generally have two main aspects:
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I've designed and developed software to infer meaning
        from language (e.g., extraction of named entities or
        knowledge); this allows humans to more easily infer meaning
        from language data, especially with large data sets. For
        example, given a number of Tweets, how many mentions of
        CompanyX are there?
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, I also support researchers and other software
        developers by developing data schemas for the representation
        of language. This facilitates collaboration and development of
        more advanced natural language processing toolkits. Many organizations
        struggle with disparate representations of data: having a unified
        schema allows progress on the organization's mission (improved
        advertisement penetration, for example) instead of engineering
        intra-company solutions to manage data.
      </p>
      <p>
        I encourage you to view my work on Github or contact me with
        any questions you may have about my work or availability.
